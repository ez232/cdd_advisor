      market_share_header: |
        Design proposals that take into account inclusivity issues can help a
        product to stand out, particularly in a saturated market. Do you think
        the recommendations could support the design proposal to differentiate
        from the competitors? Please elaborate upon your reasons.
      market_response: "Market response"
      market_response_header: |
        Inclusive designs are more likely to result in satisfied customers who
        will return and buy another product from the company. Do you think the
        statement above is applicable to this project? Please elaborate upon
        your reasons.
      volume_of_sale: "Volume of sale"
      volume_of_sale_header: |
        This design proposal excludes a number of users that may represent a
        volume of sale of %{var} units. How do you think the recommendations
        could affect the volume of sale in this proposal? Please elaborate upon
        your reasons.
      final_price: "Final price"
      final_price_header: |
        Inclusive design can reduce future investments for architectural
        redesign to make future versions of the product easier to use. In this
        design proposal, if the recommendations suggested mean more investment,
        do you think the overall cost reduction can be considered in the cost-
        benefit calculation? Please elaborate upon your reasons.
      project_timescale: "Project timescale"
      project_timescale_header: |
        Inclusive design often reduces the risk of project slippage and reduces
        development timelines. This is because there is often less need for
        rework, as rework is often required due to incorrect design and
        miscommunication. Do you think the statement above is applicable to this
        design proposal? Please elaborate upon your reasons.
      sustainability: "Sustainability"
      sustainability_header: |
        Inclusive designs may last longer in the market by reducing long-term
        development costs and increasing the revenue from each version of the
        product. Do you think the statement above is applicable to this design
        proposal? Please elaborate upon your reasons.
      social_responsibility: "Social responsibility"
      social_responsibility_header: |
        Inclusive design can help to meet Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
        goals and other aspects of the business objectives. Is this applicable
        to this project?
      impact_on_brand: "Impact on brand"
      impact_on_brand_header: |
        Products that exclude people unnecessarily, or cause frustration in the
        use of it, lead to customer dissatisfaction and can impact negatively
        (negative publicity) on brand. How do you think the recommendations
        could impact on the brand image and market perceptions of a company?
        Please elaborate upon your reasons.
      functionality: "Functionality"
      functionality_header: |
        By improving the inclusivity of your design you avoid undesired and
        unused features. How do you think the features in this proposal could
        benefit from inclusive design?
      aesthetics: "Aesthetics"
      aesthetics_header: |
        Accepting changes to a design proposal will enhance the inclusivity but
        may incur in redesigning some features to preserve the intended
        appearance. How do you think the recommendations would affect the
        appearance of the design proposal?
      manufacturing: "Manufacturing"
      manufacturing_header: |
        Accepting changes to a design proposal may incur retooling costs or
        different BOM (bill of materials), which can increase or decrease the
        final costs. How do you think the recommendations would affect the
        manufacturing costs of the product?
      components: "Components"
      components_header: |
        Do you see any change in the electronics, mechanical or other components
        that could improve inclusivity?
      usability_accessibility: "Usability-accessibility"
      usability_accessibility_header: |
        The development costs associated with user-trials, usability tests and
        other type of user-centred research are normally outweighed by the
        benefits it brings to the final product, two of which are the following:
        (1) Reduction of the need for architectural redesign to make future
        versions of the product easier to use. (2) Products easier to use that
        promote users’ satisfaction mean reduction in investment on customer
        service/ support. Do you think that user-centred research can be applied
        in this project? Please, elaborate the ways it can be applied within the
        time and budget of the project; or elaborate the reasons it could not be
        applied.

        that could improve inclusivity?

        Can you see any change in the product’s finishing that could improve
        inclusivity?

        Can you see any attributes of the design proposal or the recommendations
        suggested that could make the product last longer in the market?
